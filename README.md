Overview:
The Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) is designed to help make informed decisions regarding car replacement. It combines Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques with Present Value Analysis to evaluate whether a car should be replaced or retained, based on various factors such as maintenance costs, depreciation, and future expenses.

This project provides a structured, data-driven approach for individuals or organizations to assess the financial and operational viability of keeping or replacing a car.

Features
Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM): Evaluates multiple criteria such as maintenance costs, fuel efficiency, and the overall reliability of the car.
Present Value Analysis: Performs financial analysis by calculating the present value of future costs, taking into account depreciation, maintenance, and other long-term expenses.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for easy input of car data and straightforward output of recommendations.
Detailed Report: Provides a comprehensive analysis of the decision, helping users make the most financially sound choice.
How It Works
Data Input: The user inputs essential car data, including the age, model, maintenance costs, current value, and projected future costs.
Evaluation: The system uses MCDM methods to evaluate multiple criteria that affect the decision of keeping or replacing the car.
Financial Analysis: It applies Present Value Analysis to evaluate future costs and the long-term value of the car.
Recommendation: Based on the results, the system recommends whether to replace the car or keep it.
